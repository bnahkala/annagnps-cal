# annagnps-cal
Step-wise calibration of AnnAGNPS using Python.

Calibration is performed by calculating NSE, PBIAS, R2, and RSR for water volume in the wetland module, to emulate prairie potholes in the Des Moines Lobe of Iowa. 

Methods used in upcoming technical memo, to be submitted to Agricultural Water Management. Methods and models further used to calibrate baseline models and alternative management scenarios for thesis and publication work.
